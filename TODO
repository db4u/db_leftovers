- It'd be nice to have another Rake task that will read your database and generate a new `db_leftovers.rb` file, to help people migrating existing projects that already have lots of tables.

- Support multi-column foreign keys.

- Support custom names for foreign keys. (But then watch out excluding these from the list of indexes on MySQL!)

- Support CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY on Postgres as an option to Rake or the `define` call.

- Support NOT VALID for Postgres 9.1+ foreign keys and Postgres 9.2+ CHECK constraints.
