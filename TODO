- Abbreviated notation for conventional foreign keys:

      table :books do
        foreign_key :authors
        foreign_key :publishers, :on_delete => :cascade

        # and with a funny FK column but implicit PK of 'id':

        foreign_key :ghost_writer_id, :authors, :on_delete => :cascade
      end

  In other words, the params are foreign_key(from_table, [from_column], to_table, [to_column], [opts]).


- Print the actual WHERE-clause/CHECK expression used by postgres whenever the index/constraint is created (even the first time).

- Refactor DatabaseInterface so all methods are instance methods and Definition/DSL uses an instance, set according to the Rails database adapter and also settable to a test subclass, so we can change the definition from test to test.

- Add optional tests that use a real Postgres/MySQL/SQLite if available.
  - Run all the same tests, but against a real DatabaseInterface instance.

- Make sure everything works if the current db user has access to multiple databases: only run the code on the db given in the Rails database.yml.

- Support MySQL
