- Make sure everything works if the current db user has access to multiple databases: only run the code on the db given in the Rails database.yml.

- It'd be nice to have another Rake task that will read your database and generate a new `db_leftovers.rb` file, to help people migrating existing projects that already have lots of tables.

- Support custom names for foreign keys. (But then watch out excluding these from the list of indexes on MySQL!)
